Project: Nihon-GO!

To run the project, simply download all necessary files and run in the Godot Engine. 

Feel free to edit the user_data.json file to manually alter the current position in the progression of the game (ex: increase the "level" attribute to see more levels or add more resources to further level-up characters).

Nihon-GO! Is a fun and educational game that allows the user to practice Japanese while also experiencing enticing gameplay as well as collecting and leveling up a variety of different characters.
